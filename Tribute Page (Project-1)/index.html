          <p>
            <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
            came to be known as the <b> 'Missile Man of India'</b> for his work
            on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
            political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
            first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
            support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
            then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
            <b> "People's President" </b>, he returned to his civilian life of
            education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
            India's highest civilian honour. <br /><br />
            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
            Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest
            on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
            dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
            Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
